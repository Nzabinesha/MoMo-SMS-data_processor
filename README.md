## High-Level System Architecture
Our architecture consists of four main layers:

2. **Backend Processor** → Parses XML, cleans data, categorizes transactions  
3. **Database Layer** → Relational DB (SQLite) for structured storage  
4. **Frontend Interface** → Web app with dashboards, charts, and search/filter
